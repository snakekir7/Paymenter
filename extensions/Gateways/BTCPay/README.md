## Configuration

To set up the extension, enter the following details in the Paymenter admin panel:

- **Instance URL:** Your BTCPay Server instance URL (e.g., `https://btcpay.example.com`). Ensure no trailing slash.
- **Store ID:** Your BTCPay Store ID.
- **API Key:** API Key from BTCPay Server with the following required permissions:
  - `btcpay.store.canviewinvoices`
  - `btcpay.store.cancreateinvoice`
- **Webhook Secret:** Webhook secret used to verify payment notifications. This should match the one configured in BTCPay Server.
  Set up a webhook for **InvoiceSettled** (An invoice has been settled) event on `https://your-paymenter.url/extensions/btcpay/webhook`
- **Order Prefix (optional):** Prefix added before the order ID (e.g. `ORDER-10`).

> **Note:** Ensure that the webhook is properly configured in your BTCPay Server to enable automatic invoice marking.

### Reachability and local testing

- The **instance URL** must resolve and accept HTTPS/HTTP from your Paymenter server; otherwise checkout cannot start.
- If BTCPay is down or the URL is a non-resolving placeholder (e.g. local-only hostname without DNS), Paymenter shows a controlled error instead of a server error—check application logs for entries with message `btcpay_pay` and `reason` such as `connection_failed` or `pay_http_error` (no API keys or full response bodies are logged).
- The **webhook secret** is not required to *start* checkout, but it **is** required for the server to verify `InvoiceSettled` webhook callbacks.

## Security Notice

This extension requires sensitive information, including:
- BTCPay API Key
- Webhook Secret

To keep your transactions secure:
- Always store these credentials securely and confidentially.
